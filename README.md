DLAP is a Discord bot that lets you play local audio tracks in your server. With DLAP, you can access your music files, and share your tunes with your friends and community. DLAP offers seamless integration with Discord, so you can enjoy your music without missing a beat.

If you want to add a feature or there's anything wrong, feel free to make a fork and put a pull request.

## Looking for Maintainers
As you know, I may not keep up the project at times, or I could possibly introduce more bugs in this project. 
As well as making the code more messy. I will need to form a team in order to implement new features and make this project better. 

If you want to become a maintainer, you must at least know this source code, JavaScript and NodeJS. 
Also you must join my discord server (Support Server) to communicate with me.

# Recommended Software Requirements
- Latest version of NodeJS (v16.9.0+)
- Linux (or WSL for Windows users)
- Yarn Package Manager
- NodeJS v18.5.0+

# Configuration
Make a new file called `config.json` inside the root of your project.
```
{
    "token": "token_here",
    "musicDir": "full/relative_path_here"
    "txtFile": true/false,
    "shuffle": true/false,
    "repeat": true/false,
    "statusChannel": "channel_id",
    "voiceChannel": "voice_channel_id",

## Setting Up Bot

First you need to create a discord application ([Discord for Developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications)) to get all the tokens you need.
This application will in fact be your bot.


*IDs available on discord for developers:*
- `"clientID"`: Select your app > Settings > General Information > "Application ID"
- `"token"`: Select your app > Settings > Bot > "Reset Token" Button

*IDs available on your discord server:*
First you need [activate Developer Mode](https://linuxhint.com/enable-or-disable-developer-mode-discord/#:~:text=To%20enable%20or%20disable%20developer%20mode%20on%20Discord%2C%20first%20launch,the%20%E2%80%9CDeveloper%20Mode%E2%80%9D%20toggle.) on Discord in order to get the IDS
- `"statusChannel"`: Create a channel in your server > Right Click on top > "Copy channel ID"
- `"voiceChannel"`: Create a channel in your server > Right Click on top > "Copy channel ID"
- `"djRole"`: Create a role in your server > Right Click on top > "Copy role ID"
- `"ownerID"`: Right Click on top of yourself on a discord server > "Copy User ID" (Your User ID is not "YouName#3217")

*Music location*
- `"musicDir"`: The absolute or relative path to the directory containing music to play.

*Bool settings (set to true or false)*
- `"txtFile"`: true/false (Generates a text file)
- `"shuffle"`: true/false (Shuffle songs)
- `"repeat"`: true/false (Repeat all musics)

*Bot Activity*
- `"presenceActivity"`: Write any message here, it will be displayed in Bot's activity.
- `"activityType"`: Put any number between 0 and 5. That will be the Bot Activity type.

*Activity Types*

- `0`: Playing
- `1`: Streaming
- `2`: Listening
- `3`: Watching
- `4`: Custom
- `5`: Competing
